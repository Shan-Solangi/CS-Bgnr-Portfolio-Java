PMS - Pharmacy Management System
PMS is a pharmacy management system with a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI), allowing users to easily manage patient records. You can add, delete, update, and view any medicines information. The system also includes a login page and a dashboard for smooth navigation and control. It connects to a MySQL database using XAMPP for efficient data storage and management.
